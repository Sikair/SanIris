sikr_lehal,SHIP,"A highly specialised frigate built around a small nanoforge supplied by a deconstructor beam. This configuration allows the Lehal to manufacture missiles continuously throughout a battle, provided it can 'access' the materials to power the forge.",,,
sikr_vine,SHIP,"A highly specialized frigate built around a double-barreled autocannon directly connected to the ship's autoforge. The Vine is a sister project to the Lehal, both trying to exploit the advantages of a frigate-sized autoforge.",,,
sikr_himin,SHIP,"The Himin is designed to fit nicely in both small and large fleets, the central mount allows the ship to fill many roles. Often used as a point defense platform.",,,
sikr_dufa,SHIP,A strong frigate capable of tearing apart ships of comparable size with it's heavy frontal firepower. Captains of this ship have a notorious tendancy to engage larger targets and often pay the price of such recklessness.,,,
sikr_pond,SHIP,"A small freighter, designed to supply small patrol fleet, with enough armor not to be a liability.",,,
sikr_shion,SHIP,"Converted from a failed prototype for a phase carrier, the Shion has ample hangar space from the place once used by the phase coil. Its past also grants this ship impressive speed for a carrier.",,,
sikr_nuyre,SHIP,"Designed to be used as a spec-ops ship, the Nyure make use of a in-house modified phase coil. The weapon complement is light and prioritizes alpha strikes.",,,
sikr_bara,SHIP,"A main fleet destroyer, the Bara brings useful firepower to any parts of the fleet but performs poorly when there's no large ship to screen.",,,
sikr_echin,SHIP,A dedicated escort ship using an emp emitter to intercept fighter and missiles. The Echin can also hunt smaller craft by overwhelming them with emp arcs.,,,
sikr_marus,SHIP,"The Marus is a large scavenging platform capable of recovering even the most out of reach valuables. Carrying precious cargo, its fighter escort provides ample support should it find itself in combat. San-Iris uses these salvagers to recover their lost ships after battle.",,,
sikr_hnoss,SHIP,"A light cruiser designed to fill in gaps in San-Iris's doctrine, trade staying power for increased mobility. The numerous light mounts make it very versatile and protected from fighter and missile threat.",,,
sikr_veko,SHIP,"Durable and powerful enough to serve as anchor for small fleets, with enough firepower to fend off bigger targets. Carrying 2 energy bolt launchers as support, the Veko is the main cruiser of San-Iris's force.",,,
sikr_unnr,SHIP,A highly defense-oriented cruiser using a large shield emitter to cover allies from frontal damage and with decent weaponry to apply pressure on the enemy formation.,,,
sikr_maray,SHIP,"A frontline battlecarrier, the Maray was put into service after a long design process aiming at increasing fighter support while following the defensive wall doctrine used by San-Iris.",,,
sikr_leviathan_off,SHIP,"The counterpart to the traditional defensive Leviathan. Equipped with a ramming horn and a mobility system, the 'offense' variant is less durable but poses an incredible threat to all ships facing it directly.",,,
sikr_leviathan_def,SHIP,"The symbol of San-Iris's defence focused doctrine. The Leviathan is the shield of San-Iris territory. Serving as an unbreakable weapons platform, outlasting the strongest ship, and providing cover for smaller allied ships. Forward facing weapons make it vulnerable to flanking attacks by smaller ships and fighters, numerous PD emplacements compensates this weakness.",,,
sikr_manta,SHIP,"A large carrier with numerous hangar bays and refitting facilities. It can provides ample support to its fleet, with universal mounts suitable for any engagment.",,,
sikr_palace,SHIP,"A palace-ship, from which one can watch a battle in the comfort of a castle and its gardens, protected by an armoured canopy and guaranteed escape to p-space. A true symbol of the hypocrisy of the nobility. Few were built and today there is only one left; the Empress's dedicated ship, which is rarely seen outside major events.",,,
sikr_ocean,SHIP,"Specially designed to go underwater and withstand high pressure, while carrying magnetically locked containers. The Ocean is an engineering marvel, with hangars for escort and tug drones, good armor plating and decent speed. The only drawback is the mandatory use of non-standard containers, a minor problem for the reclusive culture of San-Iris.",,,
,,,,,
sikr_kolga,SHIP,"The light variant of the San-Iris mechs. The Kolga was designed to provide protection against enemy fighters, escort bombers and pressure small ships. All this in a light and quite cheap frame.",,,
sikr_horonn,SHIP,"The Horron was designed as a hunter, carrying two precision rifles with fragmentation bullets. It can easily shoot down other fighters and pose a threat to small ships. Although slightly slow, it only needs to hit its target once or twice.",,,
sikr_hefring,SHIP,"The heavy variant of the San-Iris mechs. The Hefring carries 2 heavy anti-ship weapons, which can counter armor and shields. Equipped with a shield to be able to stay longer in the fight. It is easy to consider this fighter as a mobile artillery piece. ",,,
sikr_jorm,SHIP,"An old LPC from before the standardization of mechs in the San-Iris forces. It has been modified to include a mech-derived joint system, which gives it the ability to aim indepedently with its 2 heavy weapons.",,,

sikr_ornnhal,WEAPON,"A missile launcher designed arroud a rotary magazine able to hold multiple missile and quickly reloaded in battle. This weapon can fire an impressive volume of ordnance, but is way less dangerous while reloading.",,,
sikr_rhodophyta,WEAPON,The paranoia of the school of offense towards small craft led to the design of this weapon. The rhodophyta tripwire can easily connect with a small target.,,,
sikr_spear_launcher,WEAPON,"Firing a high density self propelled spear, carrying vast kinetic power and the ability to bounce on shields to strike again multiple times.",,,

sikr_ontos,WEAPON,"Using a recoilless rifle that eliminates the need for a cumbersome recoil control system, makes it possible to mount a heavier caliber than normally used on this size of mount.",,,
sikr_ontos_battery,WEAPON,"A four gun configuration of the Ontos. Taking advantage of reduced stress, more ordnance can by fired than standard on a heavy mount, albeit with a slow reload.",,,

And that from it's debris the first city-ship was built, now housing the capital and the imperial palace. It is from here the eternal Empress rules over all...",,,
sikr_lily_desc,CUSTOM,"Although colonization of Lily was projected to occur simultaneously with it's blue twin, the vast majority of development took place on Iris. This left Lily with only basic infrastructure in place. It is only in the last 50 years that great efforts have been made to bring this world to the same level of greatness as Iris.",,,

sikr_fighter_damper,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Emits a dampening field from the carrier, that mitigates incoming damage to all deployed fighters.",,,
sikr_displacer,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Teleports the ship forward in the direction it's traveling. The system slowly builds up to three charges, which can then be expended in short order. Can be used while phased.",,,
sikr_shed_armor,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Regenerates a new layer of armor in an instant. Using the system spends all the current charges (max 10), regenerates 10% of the maximum armor per charge spent, the system loses efficiency with each use no matter how many charges are spent.",,,

sikr_saniris,FACTION,The San-Iris Federation came to be from colonies founded in a peculiar system with two water worlds. The first people to live there sailed the sea on enormous city-ships. Technologies to thrive on their aquatic world were quickly developed and with time the colonies became quite powerful polities in their own right. This rise to power happened outside of the domains gaze since the waterworld were deemed too costly to properly colonize.,"When the collapse occured, San-Iris announced itself to the rest of the sector, raising strange ships from it's blue oceans to sail the stars. Their large fleets are known to be extremely territorial, as is their ruler's isolationist outlook. Initial fears that San-Iris would race to fill the void left by the Domain and announce their grand designs on the Persean Sector went unfounded, they seldom leave their home system to this date.",,
